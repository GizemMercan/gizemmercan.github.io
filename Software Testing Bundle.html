<h1>Android Application Testing Bundle</h1>
<p>The bundle provides an ideal testing framework including tool supports for android graphical user interface (GUI) testing
  of a software. The framework combines the holistic and mutation testing to achieve ideal testing.
  The Details can be find in "Ideal Testing of Android Application" paper.

  The rough details including tool supports will be explained as follows considering given steps.
  <h2 id="1">1.Test preparation</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
    This part consists of the modeling of the android application under test using FSM and
    the creation of mutations from this model and then the transformation of the faultless and
    mutant FSM models into REs using JFLAP [1] tool or PQ-Analysis[2] tool. At the final step of the test preparation, the test sequences are
    generated from the corresponding RE models automatically using PQ-TestGen.
  </p>

  <p id="1.1"><b>1.1</b> First of all, fault-free model has been constructed using FSM. This step
    should be made by designer or tester using GUI specification of applications.
    A FSM will be drawn using the JFLAP  tool for the Android application at the test preparation step.
    JFLAP has been chosen for ease of use. It has a simple user interface.
    On fault-free model, each node shows the pages that the user can visit, and each edge shows the interface components that can be used between
    these page transitions. Unless designed FSM too large during modeling, it would be a better choice for scalability.

  </ul>

  <p id="1.2"><b>1.2</b>In the next step, mutant models are defined that define the unexpected conditions of
    the model except for the model showing the normal behavior of the application.This mutant model is required
    for the production of incorrect test sequences. During the creation of this model, unexpected events (transition) are
    displayed for the states to be tested.These mutant models are obtained by using FSM-specific mutation operators
    (state adding, state deleting, transition adding, transition deleting).

 </ul>

  <p id="1.3"><b>1.3</b> REs will be produced based on error-free and mutant FSMs. This will be done via JFLAP [1].  This step
    can be also done using PQ-Analysis tool, which results in longer RE models due usage of different conversion algorithm
    than JFLAP tool.

</ul>

<p id="1.4"><b>1.4</b> Test generation step is done using PQ-TestGen tool which takes inputs from the PQ-Analysis results.
    Note than there is preliminary step between model conversion and test generation called analysis step that results in
    context table, which represents the RE after analysis. The resulted tables are used in test generation algorithms.
    Test scenarios will be generated with the PQTestGen tool [3] using REs.
    For example; The regular expression produced by the following FSM (Figure 1) is A ((Sxb + Szb) b) *.

<h2 id="2">2.Testing</h2>
 <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In testing step, the test sequences generated from original and mutant models are automatically executed on original and
   mutant application, which are depending on the positive and negative testing. In the positive testing, the test set generated from the original (error-free)
   model are executed on the corresponding mutant applications.  In the negative testing, the test sets generated from the mutant models are executed on the original application.
   These steps define test execution. In test selection, the failed test sequences from positive and negative testing for each execution
   are selected to achieve ideal test suite. To this end, the proposed framework satisfies requirements of the ideal
   testing in the scope of the model of GUI.
 </p>

 <p id="2.1"><b>2.1</b> Android Studio IDE has been used for software development environment and also programming in Java. Android testing support library has been used in test execution step.
   Java code is written that automatically reads test strings and executes GUI behaviors related to them. The UI Automator tool is used for gui ripping to add gui controls for mutant applications.

</ul>

<p id="2.2"><b>2.2</b> The test set obtained from the error-free model in the positive testing is applied on the mutant android applications and the test sequences that fail in the test selection are selected.
    Similarly, in the negative testing, the test sets obtained from the mutant models are executed in the error-free android application and the test sequences that fail again in the test selection are selected.
    The word fail, as described herein, is that the test sequence actually does not yield the expected output. In other words, the test sequence is actually capable of error detection. Successful test sequences are
    the test sequence without error detection capability. At the end of the test execution, the test sequences with the ability to capture errors are the ideal test set.
