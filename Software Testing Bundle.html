  <h1>Software Testing Bundle</h1>
  <p>The bundle provides an ideal testing framework including tool supports for graphical user interface (GUI) testing
    of a software. The framework combines the holistic and mutation testing to achieve ideal testing.
    The Details can be find in "Ideal Testing of Graphical User Interface" paper.

  The rough details including tool supports will be explained as follows considering given steps.
  
  <h2 id="1">1.Test preparation</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is the first step of the framework, 
which starts with construction of the model from GUI under test (GUT).
    The GUT is modeled by means of a finite state machine(FSM) manually 
using JFLAP or PQ-Analysis tool. The model constructed is called 
original
    or fault-free FSM. Then, the mutants are generated from the original
 FSM by utilizing mutation operators that 
    are specific to the FSM. Then, the models including mutants are 
converted to the regular expressions(REs) using
    JFLAP tool or PQ-Analysis tool. At the final step of the test 
preparation, the test sequences are generated from
    the corresponding RE models automatically using PQ-TestGen and 
PQ-RanTest tools.
  </p>

  <p id="1.1"><b>1.1</b> Model construction step requires expertise of 
the designer or tester who knows basics of the GUT. However, it can be
    directly constructed from the given specification of the GUT without
 expertise and extensive human effort. In proposed
    framework, it is constructed from the GUT manually with knowledge of
 tester about the system. The JFLAP tool is preferred due to
    its easy to use interface. The FSM model is drawn using the 
interface of the JFLAP tool. Note that this step can be 
    carried by using PQ-Analysis tool but there isn't any direct 
interface exist to draw the FSM model. Therefore, the choice of 
    PQ-Analysis tool requires a basic knowledge of the tool.

  <p id="1.2"><b>1.2</b> Mutant generation step is carried manually by means of the JFLAP tool. It requires utilization of the mutation operators that 
    are a delete, insert, or replace of a state or transition of the FSM. Note that the selection and application of proper
    mutation operator, or combination of them, is based on the internal behavior of the system. Because we only focus on
    semantic fault that has a mean and changes specific behavior of the system. The selected behavior for the mutation is 
    needed to be realized at code level. Therefore, the rest of the faults are neglected from the proposed framework.

  <p id="1.3"><b>1.3</b> Model conversion step is carried out manually using JFLAP tool for original and each mutant models. This step 
    can be also done using PQ-Analysis tool, which results in longer RE models due usage of different conversion algorithm
    than JFLAP tool.

  <p id="1.4"><b>1.4</b> Test generation step is done using PQ-TestGen and PQ-RanTest tool which takes inputs from the PQ-Analysis results.
    Note than there is preliminary step between model conversion and test generation called analysis step that results in 
    context table, which represents the RE after analysis. The resulted tables are used in test generation algorithms.

  <h2 id="2">2.Testing</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In testing step, the test sequences generated from original and mutant models are automatically executed on original and
    mutant GUT, which are depending on the positive and negative testing. In positive testing, the test sequences generated
    from original model are executed on mutant GUTs that are obtained from original GUT using mutation operators at code
    level. In negative testing, the test sequences generated from mutant models are executed on original GUT. These steps
    define test execution. In test selection, the failed test sequences from positive and negative testing for each execution
    are selected to achieve ideal test suite. To this end, the proposed framework satisfies requirements of the ideal
    testing in the scope of the model of GUT.
  </p>

  <p id="2.1"><b>2.1</b> Test execution step is performed by Selenium tool for which we write a generic test script in Java. The test script
		automatically reads the test sequences and execute them on the corresponding GUT.
